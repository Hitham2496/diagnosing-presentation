# Diagnosing Issues in Software/Code Development
Presentation given on 22-08-09 at IPPP Computing Club on tackling issues at all stages in developing software, centred on software development in high energy physics.

## Points raised
 - Slide 11: I meant revert here not in the `Git` sense, rather more in its literal meaning.
             My suggestion was to check out an older version if using `Git` rather than running
             `git revert`.
 - Slide 12: Lois mentioned that the problem in the idea stage may also lie in the background
             reading that precedes the idea, it is important to be sure of the foundations
             and take them into consideration in development.
